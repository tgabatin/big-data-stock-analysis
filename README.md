# Big Data Stock Analysis

Authors:
Franz Adam, Taylor D. Gabatino

A project utilizing stock data for big data analytics.

This project will implement a big data analytics representation of various sectors of the stock market through an economic analysis of large data obtained from the years of 1996 - 2020. Various aspects of the stock market itself provide an influx of information and data, from the analysis of P/E ratio, dividends, and alternative aspects of portfolio diversification through these attributes of stocks. The unpredictability of market behavior, from the previous years expediction of GameStop & AMC have been influenced by random investor behavior. This project will attempt to predict the values of the attributes of stock data based on the information gleaned from Kaggle and Yahoo Finance, along with a business perspective in the prediction of the variation of the stock market based on this data. Using this implementation will take a different approach on aanlyzing stock data from a daily perspective of its highs and lows, and instead measure the variability of its attributes. 

## Infrastructure

The primary infrastructure of this project will be using tools to both clean and make predictions on this dataset:

* Python
    * Python will be the primary method of choice to use when programming in this project. 
    * When cleaning up larger datasets, Python will be used to discover variables that may or may not contribute valuable data to the analysis
    
* Jupyter Notebook
    * Jupyter Notebook will be the primary source of data analytics and cleaning
    
* Github
    * Github will be used for source control within this project
    
* Spark
    * Spark will be used for cleaning up the dataset if necessary, as most data may not be in the format desired
    * Spark may also be used for analysis of the data by providing the mathematical functions necessary in order to gain information
    
* Libraries in Python
    * The libraries in Python that will be used for technical analysis include (but may not be limited to):
       Keras
       TensorFlow
       Pandas
       Numpy
       Seaborn
       etc...
