    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will implement a big data analytics representation of various sectors of the stock market through an economic analysis of large data obtained from 1996-2020. Various aspects of the stock market provide an influx of information and data, from analysis of P/E ratio, dividends and alternative aspects of portfolio diversification through these attributes of stocks. The ubpredictability of market behavior, from the previous years expedition of GameStop & AMC have been influenced by random investor behavior. This project will predict the values of the attributes of stock data based ond ata obtained from Kaggle, Yahoo Finance, and Google, along with a business perspective in the prediction of variation of the stock market based on this data. Using this implementation will take a different approach on analyzing stock data from a daily perspective of its highs and lows, and instead measure the variability of its attributes. "
